Here are a few alternatives:","","Chart.js (https://www.chartjs.org/): A simple, easy-to-use library for creating responsive and interactive charts with a small bundle size. It supports bar, line, area, pie, doughnut, radar, polar, and scatter charts.","","Highcharts (https://www.highcharts.com/): A powerful, yet easy-to-use charting library that supports various chart types, such as line, spline, area, areaspline, column, bar, pie, scatter, and more. It has a clean API and is highly customizable.","","Plotly.js (https://plotly.com/javascript/): Built on top of D3.js and WebGL, Plotly.js is a high-level, declarative charting library with a wide range of chart types, including line, bar, pie, bubble, heatmap, and more. It has excellent support for interactivity and large datasets.","","ApexCharts (https://apexcharts.com/): A modern, responsive, and interactive charting library that supports various chart types, including line, area, bar, column, heatmap, radar, and more. It offers a clean API and is easy to integrate with popular frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.","","ECharts (https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html): An open-source charting library developed by Baidu, ECharts supports a wide range of chart types, such as line, bar, pie, scatter, heatmap, treemap, and more.

Here are a few alternatives:","","Chart.js (https://www.chartjs.org/): A simple, easy-to-use library for creating responsive and interactive charts with a small bundle size. It supports bar, line, area, pie, doughnut, radar, polar, and scatter charts.","","Highcharts (https://www.highcharts.com/): A powerful, yet easy-to-use charting library that supports various chart types, such as line, spline, area, areaspline, column, bar, pie, scatter, and more. It has a clean API and is highly customizable.","","Plotly.js (https://plotly.com/javascript/): Built on top of D3.js and WebGL, Plotly.js is a high-level, declarative charting library with a wide range of chart types, including line, bar, pie, bubble, heatmap, and more. It has excellent support for interactivity and large datasets.","","ApexCharts (https://apexcharts.com/): A modern, responsive, and interactive charting library that supports various chart types, including line, area, bar, column, heatmap, radar, and more. It offers a clean API and is easy to integrate with popular frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.","","ECharts (https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html): An open-source charting library developed by Baidu, ECharts supports a wide range of chart types, such as line, bar, pie, scatter, heatmap, treemap, and more. It's highly customizable and has good performance with large datasets.","","Chartist.js (https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/): A lightweight, responsive charting library that focuses on simplicity and flexibility. It supports line, bar, and pie charts and allows you to create custom chart types using SVG.","","Google Charts (https://developers.google.com/chart/): A powerful charting library developed by Google that supports a wide range of chart types, such as line, bar, area, pie, treemap, and more.
