                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>This project was nearly my everything everywhere for five months between January through May 2023 as part of my thesis for Parsons’ Master in Data Visualization program. This project was especially meaningful to me as a second generation Chinese-American. Everything Everywhere All at Once is the only film that has fully understood my experiences. To see the film being celebrated around the world while working on this project has been a joy! If you’d like to collaborate together, please email me at angelica.hom@gmail.com.</p>
                <p>DATA AND METHODOLOGY</p>
                <p>The data for this project was manually collected. The first priority was transcribing and timestamping every line of the film. The second priority was collecting metadata: which character was speaking and to whom, duration of the line, language spoken, which universe and location the line took place, and a sentiment analysis of each line with its own score based on xx. The last priority was outlining the 3-act and 15-beat structure of the film, then categorizing each line to an act and a beat.</p>
