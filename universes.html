            <p>
              Within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the multiverse concept has
              been repeatedly used to bring together unlikely characters like
              having different Spidermen or bringing Thor into Hulk’s world.

              >, “The frustrating thing about them [multiverse narratives] is
              that no one is willing to go to the logical conclusion, which is
              infinity. If every single choice branches off into another
              universe, there should be an infinite number of universes, which
              means narrative doesn’t matter; choices don’t matter. Why should
              you care at all?”

            <p>
              Everything Everywhere All at Once challenges the multiverse to be
              a philosophical issue. The choices that Evelyn makes in her
              multiverse journey significantly raise the emotional stakes since
              her relationships with everyone were already rocky to begin with.
              If you were confronted with the multiverse, wouldn’t you have an
              existential crisis?
