                <h2>The Structure</h2>
                <p>How can there be structure when the story jumps all over the place? The film can be analyzed through two screenwriting models: the three-act structure and the 15-beat sheet.</p>
                <p>The three-act structure, popularized in 1979 by Syd Field, divides a script into three acts: The Setup, which introduces the protagonist and the inciting incident; The Confrontation, which shows the protagonist repeatedly trying to resolve the issue; and The Solution, which brings the protagonist to the climax and the final resolution. The Daniels put their personal spin and renamed the three acts as: Everything, Everywhere, and All at Once.</p>
                <p>The three-act structure includes the 15-beat sheet, which was popularized by screenwriter Blake Snyder in 2005. This structure further divides the three acts into 15 beats, with each beat representing a critical turning point that transforms the protagonist.</p>
                <p>The Daniels infuse these Western-style structures with a Japanese storytelling concept called Kishōtenketsu. In an interview with <a href="https://gizmodo.com/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-interview-the-daniels-1848778652">Gizmodo</a>, Daniel Kwan explained, “Rather than the conflict pushing the story, the story is full of changes in perspectives.” Daniel Scheinert added, “I was obsessed with Princess Mononoke for the longest time… Mononoke is much more morally ambiguous. They’re trying to negotiate peace as a climax to a fantasy film, which is how we steered our film.</p>
