                    <br><br><p>In an interview with <a href="https://screencraft.org/blog/script-apart-the-daniels-unpack-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/" target='_blank'>Script Apart</a> podcast, Daniel Kwan explains, “We wanted to make sure there were no moral judgements in this film...the fact that we exist in this chaos...it’s enough to cause any well-intentioned person to hurt each other. So the opening is also just filled with these micro-aggressions. There’s like tiny moments of careless racism, careless sexism, careless ageism. It’s all in there and it’s not because any of these people are bad people, it’s because they don’t have the time to fully look at each other and say, ‘You’re a human being who contains multitudes.’”</p>
                    <br><h3>HOW TO INTERACT</h3>
                    <p>This Venn diagram shows the characteristics of each member of the Wang family. You can hover over to see where they share similarities or where they differ.</p>
                    <p>The complexities of each person, their relationship to each other, and their ability to change are what make their story of estrangement and reconciliation within a family much more powerful than a story of “good” vs “bad”.</p>
